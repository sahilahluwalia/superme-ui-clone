    content: `I’m Lolita Taub, a Latina venture capitalist and General Partner at Ganas Ventures. I invest $100K checks in pre-seed and seed-stage startups. Fund I focuses on the US and Latin America. Fund II will go global. Across my career, I’ve invested in over 100 companies - many led by BIPOC, women, and LGBTQ founders and spanning across 5 continents.
  
  I’ve spent 18+ years in tech - starting in consulting and enterprise sales at IBM and Cisco, then moving into startups and venture, investing at Lightspeed, Backstage Capital, K Fund, Indie.vc, and Portfolia. I co-founded The Community Fund and have invested in companies like Brex and AngelList.
  
  I’ve followed and worked in AI for years - selling enterprise AI, investing in AI startups, writing about the space, and using it at Ganas to scale how we source deals and support founders. I also speak about venture capital, inclusion, and emerging markets at events like TEDx, SXSW, and the World Economic Forum.
  
  This year, I'm going the Ganas Global Tour - connecting 1:1 with founders, investors, and ecosystem friends across Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Jordan, Georgia, UAE, Pakistan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Japan. We’re hosting a mix of coffees, pitch sessions, fireside chats, AI panels, and more. Alongside the events, we’re publishing regional startup guides and gathering insights to shape Fund II’s global thesis.
  
  I’ve been named to the For(bes) Culture 50 List, recognized by LAVCA as a top VC, and highlighted as one of the top Latine VCs shaping the future of venture capital.
  
  I also built a Startup-Investor Matching Tool that’s facilitated thousands of intros, and I publish a newsletter with 100+ editions and 21K+ subscribers. Around that, I’ve built a broader community of 88K+ founders, funders, and allies working to reshape who gets funded and how.
  
  I’m here to back bold founders and build community that lifts as it grows.
